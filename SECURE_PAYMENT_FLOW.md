# Secure Payment Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the new secure payment flow implemented to prevent data pollution in the database before payment confirmation.

## Problem Addressed
**Previous Flow (Insecure):**
1. User clicks "Pay Now"
2. ❌ Order immediately inserted into database with "pending" status
3. Midtrans payment gateway shown
4. If payment fails/abandoned → orphaned "pending" orders remain in database

**New Flow (Secure):**
1. User clicks "Pay Now"
2. ✅ Midtrans transaction created WITHOUT database insertion
3. Order details stored temporarily in client state
4. Midtrans payment gateway shown
5. ✅ Order only inserted to database AFTER successful payment

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

#### 1. `/app/api/midtrans/route.ts`
- **BEFORE**: Immediately creates order and order_items in database
- **AFTER**: Creates Midtrans transaction token and returns order details to client for temporary storage

#### 2. `/app/cart/page.tsx`
- **BEFORE**: Simple payment success handling
- **AFTER**: 
  - Stores `orderDetails` in component state temporarily
  - On payment success: calls `/api/orders/create` to insert order to database
  - On payment failure/close: clears temporary data

#### 3. `/app/api/orders/create/route.ts` (NEW)
- New endpoint to create order in database after payment success
- Includes duplicate prevention logic
- Sets order status as "paid" since it's called after successful payment

#### 4. `/app/api/midtrans/webhook/route.ts` (NEW)
- Handles Midtrans webhook notifications
- Updates order status if order exists
- Gracefully handles case where order doesn't exist yet (expected in new flow)

#### 5. `/app/api/payment/status/route.ts` (NEW)
- Utility endpoint to check payment status from Midtrans
- Useful for debugging and status verification

### Payment Handling Functions

#### Success Flow
```javascript
const handlePaymentSuccess = async () => {
  try {
    // Create order in database after successful payment
    if (orderDetails) {
      const response = await fetch("/api/orders/create", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({ orderDetails: orderDetails })
      })
      
      const data = await response.json()
      
      if (!data.success) {
        console.error("Failed to create order after payment:", data.message)
        // Still proceed to clear cart and redirect
      }
    }
    
    clearCart()
    router.push(`/orders/${orderId}`)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating order after payment:", error)
    // Still clear cart and redirect to avoid user confusion
    clearCart()
    router.push(`/orders/${orderId}`)
  }
}
```

#### Error/Cancel Flow
```javascript
const handlePaymentError = (error: any) => {
  console.error("Payment error:", error)
  // Clear temporary data on payment error
  setPaymentToken(null)
  setOrderDetails(null)
  setOrderId(null)
  setIsCheckingOut(false)
  router.push("/payment/failed")
}

const handlePaymentClose = () => {
  // Payment popup was closed - clear temporary data
  setPaymentToken(null)
  setOrderDetails(null) 
  setOrderId(null)
  setIsCheckingOut(false)
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Data Integrity**
- No orphaned "pending" orders in database
- Orders only exist when payment is confirmed

### 2. **Security**
- Reduced attack surface
- No manipulation of unpaid orders possible

### 3. **Performance**
- Cleaner database with only valid orders
- No need for cleanup processes

### 4. **User Experience**
- Same user experience as before
- Better error handling and recovery

## Database Schema Compatibility

The implementation maintains full compatibility with existing database schema:
- Orders table structure unchanged
- Order items table structure unchanged
- Order tracking views work as expected
- Admin panel functionality preserved

## Testing Checklist

### Happy Path
- [ ] User can add items to cart
- [ ] User can fill in customer information
- [ ] User can select pickup outlet and time
- [ ] Payment gateway opens correctly
- [ ] Successful payment creates order in database
- [ ] User is redirected to order details page
- [ ] Cart is cleared after successful payment

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Payment cancellation clears temporary data
- [ ] Payment failure doesn't create database entries
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Duplicate order creation is prevented

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Webhook arrives before client creates order
- [ ] Webhook arrives after client creates order
- [ ] Multiple payment attempts for same order ID
- [ ] Browser refresh during payment process

## Webhook Configuration

Ensure Midtrans webhook is configured to point to:
```
POST /api/midtrans/webhook
```

The webhook will:
1. Process payment status updates
2. Update existing orders if found
3. Log cases where orders don't exist (expected in new flow)

## Monitoring

Monitor the following:
1. **Success Rate**: Orders created vs payment attempts
2. **Webhook Processing**: Successful webhook processing rate
3. **Error Logs**: Failed order creation after successful payment
4. **Database Cleanup**: Absence of orphaned pending orders

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback involves:
1. Revert `/app/api/midtrans/route.ts` to immediately create orders
2. Revert cart page payment handlers
3. Remove new API endpoints
4. Monitor for any data inconsistencies

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a more secure and reliable payment flow while maintaining backward compatibility and user experience. The approach eliminates database pollution from failed payments and provides better error handling throughout the payment process.
